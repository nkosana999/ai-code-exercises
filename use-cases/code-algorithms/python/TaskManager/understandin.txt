Initial undersating

- This is a task manangement program,
- It is devided into multiple files of classes that acts as tools.
- It appears to use Enum which is new to me and it also uses uuid and datetime module 
- The main components are  cli.py which I think runs the program and models.py which is acts as foundation structure to every file.


Updated undersating

- It is indeed a task management program. 
- It is built using only python standard libraries

- Main files - cli.py (This is the main file for running the entire program form the terminal)
             - model.py (creating unique events objects)
             - storage.py (ensure storing of events on the hard drive so they are not lost when you close the terminal.)                        

- You run it through command line arguments
 
- functiionality - Create and save events 
                 - List existing events
                 - Update existing events
